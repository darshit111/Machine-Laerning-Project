* Created a regression model to predict vehicle mileage based on features such as engine specifications and vehicle weight.
* Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to identify key factors affecting mileage.
* Implemented feature scaling and regularization techniques for optimal model performance.
* Achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) reduction of Y% over initial models.
* Tools and technologies used: Python, linear regression, matplotlib, seaborn.
